# reddit-mimic-app

This is a React/Redux application I'm currently working on that makes a request to Reddit's API and renders content to the page.

Currently, upon load, the app renders posts from Reddit's home page.  You can do an open search accross all of Reddit, or you may select
a subReddt and search within that sub.

While still a work in progress. You may view a live sample of the app [here](https://www.reddit-dark.com/)

Thanks for looking!
