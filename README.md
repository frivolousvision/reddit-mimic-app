# reddit-mimic-app

This is a React/Redux application I'm currently working on that makes a GET request to Reddit's API and renders content to the page.

Currently, upon load, the app renders posts from Reddit's hone page.  You may then search posts through a inputting a combination of 
the subReddit you wish to search and a search term.
